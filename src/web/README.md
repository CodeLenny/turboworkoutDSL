A bare bones HTML/Javascript implementation, allowing a user to enter a workout in the language into a window, click a button, and have the ERG/MRC file appear in another window.

The javascript was created from the ruby source using [Opal](https://opalrb.org) and the command
`opal -c --no-opal -V tomrc.rb > tomrc.js`
